## Variables, Types and Operators

Be able to explain what variables are. Understand variable types, allowed names, and valid values.
Know how to create and use string, integer, floating-point, and boolean variables.

### Part 1 - PricelessScript.java - [MasterCard YouTube Ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_6stXKGuHo)

The lab template contains a program that prints the following:
```
2 tickets: $28.00
2 hotdogs, 2 popcorn, 2 sodas: $18.00
1 autographed baseball $45.00
real conversation with 11 year old son: priceless
true
```

Ignore the code that you don't fully recognize and concentrate on changing the variables to alter the MasterCard *Priceless* script to say:
```
3 tickets: $42.00
3 hotdogs, 3 popcorn, 3 sodas: $27.00
2 autographed baseball $90.00
watching the Giants win: priceless
false
```

### Part 2 - Interpretation
Take note of the various variables and their data types. Write a brief summary in this section of the README.md file listing the:
* Variable name
* Its data type
* and example values you can assign them.

Next give TWO example variable names and TWO example variable assignments that are *WRONG* and explain why.
* Hint: your IDE can help you discover these!

Answers:

Varaiable type: string  
Its data type is to store text. 
A string can contain spaces as well as letters, numbers, and punctuation marks. 
A string can be up to 32,767 characters long

Variable type: int
Its data type is to store integers and no floating-point numbers or decimal number.
A int can contain any integer containing digits 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. 

Variable type: boolean
booleans can only contain true or false statements, an example variable assignment that is wrong would be anything that is not true or false in this case, 
such as an int or a floating-point number, or any text.

Variable type: floating-point numbers
floating-point numbers are variables for decimals and any equations involving division that outputs a fraction/decimal.
An example of a variable assignment that is wrong would be any double containing any text. It is legal to use int values, 
but it is not common practice, if you are going to use int values they should be put in decimal form. 

### Part 3 - Bonus: Play around with Java String Format Specifiers.

Pick several of the Java format specifiers below and define variables of the correct type utilize *sout* and *String.format* to view the resulting formats.

### Part 4 - Submission
* Just as you did last week (Reference the Lab video in your Week 1 module), create a Spring2023 feature branch of your code
* Commit your working code to your local copy
* Push it to your Remote/origin branch (i.e. GitHub: Spring2023 -> origin/Spring2023)
* Then issue a Pull request to my instructor branch
    * Make sure to save the Pull request URL and submit it for the lab.
